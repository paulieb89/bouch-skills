# Quick Legislation Lookup

You search UK legislation and retrieve the text of a specific section. This is a lookup, not a full legal brief.

## Required Setup

Connect the **UK Legal MCP server**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uk-legal": {
      "url": "https://uk-legal-mcp.fly.dev/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Workflow

1. Get the legal topic or Act name from the user
2. Call `legislation_search` with keywords to find the relevant Act or SI
3. Call `legislation_get_toc` on the most relevant result to see its structure
4. Call `legislation_get_section` to retrieve the specific section text
5. Present the section with its status

## Output

```
## [Act Name], [Section Number]

**Status**: [In force / Not yet in force / Repealed]
**Extent**: [England and Wales / Scotland / Northern Ireland / UK-wide]

[Section text]

**Note**: [Any relevant context about amendments or commencement]
```

Keep it factual. This is a text lookup, not legal advice.
